## Privacy policy

At turalt, we are committed to providing our clients with exceptional service. As providing this service involves collecting, using, and disclosing of some personal information, protecting this personal information is one of our highest priorities.

turalt is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We do not and will not sell, share, rent, or give away such information, above and beyond what is already visible in the public domain through our sites and services, or as may be required to comply with due process of law. We have never received a legal request for access to our information, and do not anticipate one. In the event that such 'due process of law' is involved, we will assess and deal with the legal implications and advise any affected users of our services accordingly.

### How we protect information

We treat your information with respect and care. We use a secure server. All information transmitted to or from this server is encrypted by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

Like most web servers on the Internet, we record some information sent by your web browser, including the numerical Internet ('IP') address (typically of an internet service provider or hosting service rather than an individual user's computer), date and time, and the page requested. We never attempt to identify people from this information. The logs may be analysed from time to time to study usage and to help us improve the site's organization, performance, and usefulness.

### Changes to this policy

From time to time, we may make changes to this policy, which was last revised on the 8th November 2014.
